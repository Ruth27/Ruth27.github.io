#### Professional Cardmaker?? Never seen that before  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyone else finds Safeway and Papyrus cards hella pricy? But then you still buy it because it's your best friend's birthday and you wanna make it special so you placate yourself by calling it a "occasional" splurge? ( ᐛ )و


Three years ago while surfing on Youtube, I accidently discovered a channel called [K Werner Design](https://www.youtube.com/user/starofmay)，and I was then forever sucked into the rabbit hole of the card-making world.  


P.S: check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ruru_the_cardmaker/) where I sell my cards ≧(´▽｀)≦

# How do I Start|
Ans: **COPY OTHERS**

This is my first card (neglecting the countless I did as a child):

It was devoid of absolutely any skill nor technique. I merely took some watercolor and splattered it on the paper (after masking the little girl and her umbrella), then wrote an intellgible quote... Not at all the rainbows and unicorns you see on professional cards *cough cough down below*

This [iNcrEdiBLe artist](https://www.youtube.com/user/jennifermcguireink) used [Tim Hortlz Alcohol Ink](https://rangerink.com/collections/tim-holtz-alcohol-inks),  gold/silver Embossing powders and embossing ink, and stamp set... All of these amounts to the hundreds of dollars. So for amateurs like us, they're really unnecessary.

Nonetheless, we can still create some lit effects. In my three years of card-making, I have really just depended on white poster boards, 24-color watercolor, double-sided tape, ✂️, white craft foam, and sequences, all of which are loyal tenants of the dollar store (*´・ｖ・) with the exception of one special guest: [Tim Hortlz Distress Ink](https://rangerink.com/collections/tim-holtz-distress-ink-pads). This is probably the best purchase I've made. As of now, I am still finding ways of employing them.
