So, you're asking, why a blog?

Well. You might as well have just asked me, why do I, an intellectual individual striving to leave a dent in this beautiful yet ugly world, want to better my character and build my identity by self-reflection and self-ranting?

Yep.



#### Who am I

I am a CBC (Canadian Born Chinese) (no I'm not a broadcasting station) in B.C, Canada. 

Just like any other teenagers, I stress about school, drink bubble tea with friends, watch YouTube, attend clubs...

Just like any other girls, I love dressing up (guys can dress up too!), complain about that time of the month, gossip profusely...

Just like any other Asian, I **NEED** straight As, play piano and badminton, study relentlessly in the wean hours of the night, binge watch twoset violin...

But I would like to think I'm not just another carbon copy of the teenage Asian girl.

So, as much as I am imparting my experiences to the deep, dark internet, I am trying to find myself along the way too.
